## Pythogorean Theorem
In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras’s theorem, is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and c, often called the “Pythagorean equation”

where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b the lengths of the triangle’s other two sides.

### Example:
Look here is the simplest way, lets say you need to find the square root of 900. You do the prime factorization, which is dividing 900 by prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11… etc. 
you will most probably get 2X2X5X5X3 (maybe in a different order) and if you see that is equal to 900. So now take only 1 of each number, you must have gotten 2X5X3. Now you multiply the numbers 2X5=10, 10X3=30. 
#### That is your answer, the square root of 900 = 30.
